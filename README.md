# generics

A tool to easily create mobile-aware web site based on database stored data.

Useful for EC-sites with plenty of products to sell, or restaurants with grand menus to be updated periodically.

Because it generates static HTML pages, generated site can be hosted on any web server, including Amazon S3, Github Pages, Bitbucket pages, and of course Heroku.
